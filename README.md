A web browser extension (currently Chrome) that helps you stay focused by blocking sites during work timers and letting you browse during break timers, pomodoro style.
Will port to other browsers soon.

**Important note:** I have contributed very little to this project. This is mostly a maintained fork with some pull requests put in, and a rebrand with a coat of paint. 

**Pull requests:** Feel free to make some pull requests. I use this extension regularly and will do my best to merge good requests.

A cross-platform web browser extension that helps you stay focused by blocking sites during work timers and letting you browse during break timers, pomodoro style.

Okay, well, it'll be cross-platform when I add more features. For now, it's Firefox only.

**Important note:** I have contributed very little to this project. This is mostly a maintained fork with some pull requests put in, and a rebrand with a coat of paint. The rebrand is a work in progress.

**Pull requests:** Feel free to make some pull requests. I use this extension regularly and will do my best to merge good requests.
